Running the Script
------------------
To execute a recipe, run the following command:

python  make-datasets.py -d your_data_name

For your_data_name provide the name of the recipe before the .json, so in this case the recipe name is your_data_name.json

Notes: 
^^^^^^

To run the make-datasets.py script, you must be in the same folder as the script

Your recipe must be in the recipes folder
